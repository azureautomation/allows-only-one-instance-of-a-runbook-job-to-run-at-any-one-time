.SYNOPSIS
    Allows only one instance of a runbook job to run at any one time.

.DESCRIPTION
    This runbook ensures that only one instance of a runbook is running at
    any one time. It is meant to be called from another runbook as an inline runbook, 
    not started asynchronously through the web service.

.PARAMETER AutomationAccountName
    The name of the Automation account where this runbook is started from

.PARAMETER AzureOrgIdCredential
    A credential setting containing an Org Id username / password with access to this Azure subscription 

.PARAMETER SubscriptionName
    The name of the Azure subscription

.PARAMETER Lock
    A boolean value of true will make this job wait if another job is already running for this runbook.
	If set to false it unlocks the next job so it can run.

.EXAMPLE
    Set-RunbookLock -AutomationAccountName "FinanceTeam" -AzureOrgIdCredential 'AD-UserName' -Lock $True
 
    Set-RunbookLock -AutomationAccountName "FinanceTeam" -AzureOrgIdCredential 'AD-UserName' -Lock $True -SubscriptionName 'Visual Studio Ultimate with MSDN'
